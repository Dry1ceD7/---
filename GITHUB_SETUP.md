# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed, please follow these steps to create the repository manually:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `advanced-vending-machine-age-verification`
   - **Description**: `Advanced Vending Machine Age Verification System with Thai National ID Card Integration, Biometric Verification, and MDB Protocol Support`
   - **Visibility**: Public
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/advanced-vending-machine-age-verification.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up Repository Features
1. **Enable Issues**: Go to Settings > General > Features and enable Issues
2. **Enable Discussions**: Go to Settings > General > Features and enable Discussions
3. **Set up branch protection**: Go to Settings > Branches and add rules for main branch
4. **Add topics**: Go to the repository main page and add topics like:
   - `vending-machine`
   - `age-verification`
   - `thai-national-id`
   - `smart-card`
   - `biometric`
   - `mdb-protocol`
   - `pc-sc`
   - `iso-7816`
   - `facial-recognition`
   - `privacy-compliant`

### 4. Create Initial Issues
Create these initial issues to track development:
1. "Set up development environment and dependencies"
2. "Implement Thai National ID card reading functionality"
3. "Integrate biometric facial recognition system"
4. "Implement MDB protocol communication"
5. "Add security and encryption features"
6. "Create web interface for system management"
7. "Set up monitoring and logging"
8. "Write comprehensive tests"
9. "Create deployment documentation"
10. "Set up CI/CD pipeline"

### 5. Create Project Board
1. Go to the "Projects" tab
2. Create a new project called "Advanced Vending Machine Development"
3. Add columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done"
4. Add the issues created above to the board

## Repository Structure
The repository is already set up with:
- ✅ Complete project structure
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Source code with all components
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Docker setup
- ✅ Package.json with all dependencies
- ✅ Git history with initial commit
- ✅ .gitignore file
- ✅ README.md with full documentation

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup
1. Clone the repository on your development machine
2. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` to set up the development environment
3. Start development following the BMAD methodology
4. Use the project board to track progress
5. Create pull requests for each feature
6. Set up automated testing and deployment
